# Infinite Scrolling Application

This Flutter application demonstrates infinite scrolling functionality along with search and filtering features. It ensures compatibility with Chrome/Desktop browsers and can be run using `flutter run -d chrome` or `flutter run -d mac`.

## Features

- **Infinite Scroll**: Load more content dynamically as the user scrolls through the feed.
- **Search/Filter**: Allows users to search and filter content based on specific criteria.
- **Predictable Sorting**: Ensures that the feed's ranking/sorting remains consistent to prevent arbitrary re-ordering of items.

1. Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/Jaspreet-10/Infinite-Scrolling-Application.git

2. Navigate into the project directory:
